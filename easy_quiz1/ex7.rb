# What is the default thing that Ruby will print to the screen if you call to_s on an object? 
# => it is the object id and a readable representation of the instance variables and their values

# Where could you go to find out if you want to be sure?
# => since all objects in Ruby inherit from the 'Object' class,
# we can verify in the 'Object' documentation
